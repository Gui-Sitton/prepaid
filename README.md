# Which.is.the.Best.Plan


In this project I work as an analyst for the telecommunications company Megaline. The company offers its customers pre-paid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The sales department wants to know which plans bring in the most revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.
I carried out an initial analysis of the plans based on a small selection of customers. I obtained data from 500 Megaline customers: which customers they are, where they are from, which plan they use, the number of calls they made and messages they sent in 2018. My job is to analyze customer behavior and determine which prepaid plans bring in the most revenue.

**Description of plans**

Note: Megaline rounds seconds to minutes, and megabytes to gigabytes. For calls, each individual call is rounded up: even if a call only lasted a second, it will be counted as a minute. For web traffic, individual web sessions are not rounded up. Instead, the total for the month is rounded up. If someone uses 1025 megabytes this month, they will be charged for 2 gigabytes.

**Surf**

Monthly price: $20
500 minutes per month, 50 text messages and 15 GB of data
After exceeding the package limits:
1 minute: 3 cents
1 text message: 3 cents
1 GB of data: $10

**Ultimate**

Monthly price: $70
3000 monthly minutes, 1000 text messages, and 30 GB of data
After exceeding the package limits:
1 minute: 1 cent
1 text message: 1 cent
1 GB of data: $7

**Test the hypotheses**

* The average revenue of Ultimate and Surf users is different.
* The average revenue of users in the NY-NJ area is different from users in other regions.

**Conclusion**

Because the Surf plan has a lower limit, many people pay extra for usage, often exceeding the value of the Ultimate plan, thus bringing in more money for the company. The ultimate plan does not, all users pay 70 dollars. We can't say that the NY-NJ region's revenue is the same as the rest, but its average is a little lower than the rest.
